The following is a list of all redirect codes:

* 301 Moved Permanently
* 302 Found
* 303 See Other
* 307 Temporary Redirect
* 308 Permanent Redirect

The 301 redirect code is the most common redirect code. It is used to tell the client that the requested resource has been permanently moved to a new location. The 302 redirect code is used to tell the client that the requested resource has been temporarily moved to a new location. The 303 redirect code is similar to the 302 redirect code, but it is used to tell the client to use the GET method to access the new location. The 307 redirect code is used to tell the client that the requested resource has been temporarily moved to a new location, but the client should use the same HTTP method to access the new location. The 308 redirect code is similar to the 301 redirect code, but it is used for permanent redirects that are caused by changes in the HTTP protocol.

Redirect codes are used for a variety of purposes, such as:

* To redirect clients to a new URL after a website has moved.
* To redirect clients to a secure HTTPS connection.
* To redirect clients to a different version of a website, such as a mobile version.
* To redirect clients to a different language version of a website.
* To prevent clients from accessing outdated or deleted content.

Redirect codes are an important part of the web, and they are used by websites of all sizes.
